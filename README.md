# To-Do List API

## Problem Description

---

**A To-Do API where users(developers), can signup, login, edit their profile, create a to-do, edit their to-do, see the list of all to-do created, retrieve a particular todo, and delete a todo. 
When a user signup, s/he should recieve an activation email. The user should be able to perform the CRUD functionality, i.e creating a to-do, retrieving a single to-do, updating a to-do and also deleting a to-do.
A user can create multiple to-dos.**

### Implementation 1

**A user should be authenticated to be able to create a to-do list. The user should be able to create multiple to-do list and also retrieve a single to-do list. Each user has a unique ID and each to-do list created has a unique ID as well.**

### Implementation 2

**A user should be able to retrieve a single to-do list by the unique ID, update/edit it, and delete.**

### Implementation 3

**The consumer of this API should be able to retrieve the data for all users and as well as the data for a single user by their unique ID.**
